# DNS DriveBy
DNS-Driveby automatically exfiltrates wardriving & GPS data through open WiFi networks, using DNS requests.  This circumvents the need for LTE communication on low-cost tracking devices.

This implementation uses a $2 ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller, a $3 GPS Module, and battery components.

Build instructions & documentation coming soon.
