## What is DNS DriveBy?     
DNS-Driveby automatically exfiltrates wardriving & GPS data through open WiFi networks, using DNS requests.  This circumvents the need for LTE communication on low-cost tracking devices.
## Components
This implementation uses a $2 ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller, a $3 GPS Module, and battery components.
## Build & Compile
Build instructions & documentation coming soon.  You'll need to register a [DNS CanaryToken](https://canarytokens.org).
